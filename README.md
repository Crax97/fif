# FiF: Find in Files

### Why? 
I often find myself searching for patterns (e.g words, function names) into my company's code base, i decided to develop a small tool to do this task from the cli.

### Usage
`cargo run --release [source directory] [pattern to look for]`

### Couldn't you just use something else/bash scripting etc...?
Probably, yeah

### ToDo list
* Add support for regexes
* Add support for CLI options
* Probably improve readability
* Add releases
